    "## Welcome to the World of Convolutions!\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous homework, you explored **Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs)**—the foundational building blocks of deep learning. You saw how MLPs can learn patterns from data, predict phonemes from speech, and even approximate complex functions. However, despite their expressive power, MLPs are not well-suited for image data. Flattening an image into a one-dimensional vector discards crucial **spatial information**, such as how neighboring pixels relate to one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "This limitation motivates the use of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. CNNs preserve spatial structure by operating directly on image grids, allowing models to learn meaningful visual patterns. In doing so, they bring us closer to designing systems that can truly *see* and interpret the visual world.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework, you will dive into CNNs through **face classification** and **face verification** tasks. In face classification, the goal is to identify a face as belonging to one of several known identities. In contrast, face verification asks a different question: *Do these two images belong to the same person?*—even if that person was never seen during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this concrete, imagine being given a photo of a friend and a group photo. A classifier would attempt to name your friend, while a verification model would simply determine whether the two images depict the same individual. CNNs enable this by learning **hierarchical features**: early layers capture edges and textures, while deeper layers encode higher-level concepts such as facial structures and distinctive features.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key theme of this assignment is understanding how **loss functions** shape model behavior. Classification models typically rely on **Cross-Entropy Loss**, which encourages correct label prediction. Verification tasks, however, depend on learning meaningful **embeddings**, where similarity in feature space reflects identity similarity. Loss functions such as **Triplet Loss** or **ArcFace Loss** are designed for this purpose, pulling embeddings of the same person closer together while pushing different identities apart. A well-trained verification model can even distinguish between visually similar individuals—such as siblings—while remaining robust to changes in pose, lighting, or expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond theory, this homework emphasizes **practical deep learning skills**. You will preprocess image data, apply data augmentation techniques (e.g., random cropping or flipping), and experiment with modern CNN architectures such as **ResNet** or **ConvNeXt**. Along the way, you will discover that a model optimized for classification is not automatically suitable for verification—highlighting the importance of aligning architectural choices and loss functions with the task at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this assignment, you will have built a robust face recognition system inspired by real-world applications, from smartphone unlocking to identity verification systems. Let’s get started."
